## Program Goals
To create an ordering system for a food truck menu.

The system should have a dictionary containing all menu items and prices.
User is able to select from a menu, select the item they want, select the amount they wish to buy, and repeat the process until they are satisfied and ready to check out. Then, the program displays all the items in their "cart" in a properly formatted recipt-style table and calculates the total cost of all the items.

## Resources Utilized
This section is dedicated to keep track of what I used to help complete this program (because I certainly am NOT at the skill level to be able to pull all this out of my butt yet.)

60% class notes

20% AI powered by OpenAI's GPT 3.5

10% Google

10% asking questions in Slack

## Update Log
11/5/2023: Began initial work on project, which included creating github repository. Order system is complete and functional. Order Recipt is yet to be attempted, but I can't imagine it will take very long (my desk is made of wood and I am knocking)

11/6/2023: Went a little ham with the print(dashes) thing just to make it all nice and pretty. Made some progress on order recipt.
